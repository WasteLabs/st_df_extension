Streamlit released a native new [data-frame editor](https://blog.streamlit.io/editable-dataframes-are-here/). There is also a tutorial of adding [advanced filtering to dataframes](https://blog.streamlit.io/auto-generate-a-dataframe-filtering-ui-in-streamlit-with-filter_dataframe/) via normal streamlit components.

This package combines the funcionality of both.

For more info, see the official [DataFrames](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/dataframes?ref=streamlit) documentation.

There is a live example [on Streamlit Cloud](https://wastelabs.co/).
